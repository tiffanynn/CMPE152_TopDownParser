# CMPE152_TopDownParser

Assignment #2 for CMPE 152 in C++

**By**: Austin Tran, Tiffany Nguyen, Tien Tran, and Hanna Oh



Instructions on building the parser:
1. Download our package and unzip it. Save it all in one folder. (We apologize for the lack of folder organization compared to the sample code)
2. For IDE, import everything and have a C++ compiler installed. Then, build it and run it.


** For Terminal, download a g++ compiler if not done so using the command on Terminal: sudo apt-get install build-essential

** Then, we compiled our main test file  in the command: gcc+ 

** Just type "./a.out" and the output will show up on the terminal
